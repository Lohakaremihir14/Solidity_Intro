# Solidity : Beginner EVM Course
In this course I was learnt the some basic concepts about Web3 and Blockchain along with the solidity programming. There are various concepts of solidity I learnt from this course like as
1.Variables
2.Datatypes
3.Mapping
4.Functions.,etc,
There is a project after completion of all three given modules.

## Overview about the Challenge

In this challenge I have to created contract name as MyToken give a string named "boult" abbreviated as "audio" along with the record of its total supply. 
For mint , I put a certain value to mint it will increase the totalsupply and balance as well.
For Burn , I put a certain value to Burn it will decrease the totalsupply and balance as well.

### Procedure

* I used the Online Remix IDE for writing the solidity code Program with a version (pragma solidity 0.8.18).
* Then I created a file named as intro.sol for publishing that same code on GitHub.

### The Code

* If you are using Remix IDE then you simply compile the code from the bar.
* After compiling the code , you have to deploy the Contract from the bar.
* After deploying the code , you have to enter certain inputs according to requirement of smart contract. 

## Overall Experience 

I was new in this technology when I started to learn . The pathways are properly designed to create over environment . Experience was good enough and I would like to do another courses also.
